## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/monument-identification.git
   cd monument-identification
   
2. Dataset
The model is trained on a diverse dataset of satellite images containing monuments from various locations globally.

3. Model Architecture
The deep learning model is constructed using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. For detailed information on the model architecture, layers, and parameters, consult the model.py file.
